# ContestWatcherBot
ContestWatcherBot is a Telegram bot that keeps track of all the major online programming contests. It sends you notifications one day and one hour before each event. Try it your self at https://t.me/contestwatcherbot

## Judges
Currently we support the following websites:
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)
- [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/)
- [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com)

You can choose which notifications you will receive by enabling/disabling each website. Use `/help` for more information.

## Codeforces integration

Since Codeforces has a very nice [API](http://codeforces.com/api/help) we can keep track not only of the upcoming contests but also of system testing and rating changes. You can add your Codeforces handle to the bot and it will notify you about system testing and rating changes of the contests that you took part. Use `/help_handles` for more information.

## Contributing

We gladly accept contributions! We plan to write better documentation for the code, but if you feel like you can contribute, you are very welcome to do so :-)
